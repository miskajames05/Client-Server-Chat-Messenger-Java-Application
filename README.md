# Client-Server-Chat-Messenger-Java-Application

This application is a Client-Server Chat program design, coded, and tested using Eclipse Java Neon (Java 8). This program uses Transmission Control Protocol to implement the communication between the client and server sides. Threads are used to allow multiple clients to exchange data with the server at once.

This Java application allows a user to do the following:
  - create an account
  - cancel their account
  - login to the system
  - see the current users who are logged-in to the system
  - call an online user (request to chat)
  - if user A calls user B, user B can either accept or reject the call
  - either use partipating in a chat session can end the session

The Server is run through the class Server_Main and Client side is run through the class Client.
